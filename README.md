# phone_book

here as a DevOps Engineer we are going to create infrastructure with terraform. Terraform allows us to create infrstructure by using codes. 
In other words terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

We take phonebook.py python app from developers. Then we will deploy it by using terraform.

For our purposes we need to create:
  - security groups
  - main.tf
  - provider.tf
  - outputs.tf
  
 Here we devide our terraform file in different sub files in order to manage them easiyl. With help of this structure we can manage and implement our terraform files
 easier.
